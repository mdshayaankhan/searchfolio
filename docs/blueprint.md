## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A desaturated blue (#579BB1) to capture the essence of Google's minimalist aesthetic while retaining a professional look. It will be suitable for highlights and buttons.
- Background color: Very light blue/grey (#F5F8FA). To give a clean, bright feel similar to the Google homepage. This color subtly enhances the content without distracting from it.
- Accent color: Light cyan (#85C4E3). The color complements the primary blue. To indicate interactive elements and call-to-action items.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, clean, and readable appearance.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying inline code snippets if necessary.
- Use simple, line-based icons that complement the minimalist design. The style should follow Googleâ€™s Material Design guidelines.
- Maintain a centered layout with consistent padding and margins to create a balanced and visually appealing interface.
- Implement subtle animations and transitions (e.g., fade-in, slide-up) to enhance user experience and provide visual feedback.
